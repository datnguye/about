=== BAD APPROACH ===
Query fix (bad approach):
[94m**Short answer**

```sql
-- If `age` is a numeric (e.g. INT, SMALLINT, etc.):
SELECT * 
FROM users 
WHERE age = 25;
```

**Why that fixes the query**

| Problem in the original | What it does | What to change | Reason |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| `age = '25'` (string literal) | Imposes an implicit cast that can degrade performance, and may even lock the column unnecessarily. | Use a numeric literal (`25`) or CAST it explicitly. | Matching the data type keeps the column indexed and avoids implicit conversions. |
| `SELECT *` | Pulls every column, which can mean more I/O, memory pressure, and network traffic than necessary. | List only the columns that you actually need (e.g. `id, name, email`). | Minimises data transfer and makes the intent clear to the DB engine. |
| No parameterization | If you‚Äôre embedding this query in application code, you risk SQL‚ÄëInjection. | Use placeholders (`?`, `$1`, etc.) depending on your driver. | Defensive programming ‚Äì safer and more maintainable. |

### Full example with good practices

```sql
-- Example with a SELECT list and a prepared‚Äëstatement placeholder
SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
WHERE age = $1;   -- or ? / @age depending on your DB client
```

```postgresql
-- (PostgreSQL example)
PREPARE get_users_by_age(integer) AS
  SELECT id, name, email
  FROM users
  WHERE age = $1;

-- Execute with the numeric age value
EXECUTE get_users_by_age(25);
```

---

### If you really *must* keep `age` as a string

If your schema is weird and `age` is stored as a text column, you can still write the query in a slightly cleaner way:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age = CAST('25' AS text);   -- or just keep '25' but avoid the extra quotes
```

But the preferred course of action is to store numeric data in numeric columns.

---

### Quick checklist

1. **Match data types** ‚Äì no unnecessary quotes around numeric constants.  
2. **Select only needed columns** ‚Äì replace `*` with an explicit list.  
3. **Use parameters** ‚Äì if the value comes from user input or app code.  
4. **Test** ‚Äì verify that the result set is still what you expect after the change.  

After applying the above, your query should run more efficiently and be safer to maintain. Happy querying![0m

==================================================

=== GOOD APPROACH ===
Query fix (good approach):
[94mBelow is a ‚Äúfix‚Äëup‚Äù that addresses the two most important goals for a production‚Äëgrade query in a user‚Äëtable: **security** (avoid injection) and **performance** (use the right data types, indexes and only the columns you need).  

---

## 1. The original query

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = '25';
```

### Problems

| Issue | What it does | Why it hurts |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| `age = '25'` | Treats the literal as a **string** | If `age` is an `INT` column the DB will cast the string to a number, wasting CPU ops. |
| `SELECT *` | Returns every column | Unnecessary I/O, larger result set, more bandwidth, and increases the cost of any covered index. |
| No parameterisation | If this statement is built with string concatenation, it‚Äôs vulnerable to SQL‚ÄëInjection. | An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL if any part of the query were derived from user input. |
| No index hint | If the `age` column isn‚Äôt indexed, the query will scan the whole table. | Poor perf, especially on large tables. |

---

## 2. A better rewrite

### a. Use the correct data type

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, age        -- <‚Äë list only what you really need
FROM users
WHERE age = 25;                     -- <‚Äë integer literal, no quotes
```

**Why?**  
*No implicit casting* ‚Äì the engine reads the integer column straight from the index or data pages, which is faster.  

### b. Create an index (once)

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_age ON users(age);
```

An index on the filter column lets the optimiser perform an index lookup instead of a full table scan.

### c. Parameterise in your application

> **Never concatenate user data into the SQL string.**  
> Bind a value, and let the driver handle quoting, escaping and type conversion.

**Example in PHP with PDO**

```php
$age = 25;  // or whatever comes from user input after validating it‚Äôs an int

$sql = 'SELECT id, name, email, age FROM users WHERE age = :age';
$stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
$stmt->bindValue(':age', $age, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt->execute();

$rows = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

**Example in Python with `psycopg2` (PostgreSQL)**

```python
age = 25
cur.execute("""
    SELECT id, name, email, age
    FROM users
    WHERE age = %s
""", (age,))
rows = cur.fetchall()
```

---

## 3. Optional enhancements

| Enhancement | When to use | Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Covering index** | `SELECT age, id, name, email FROM users WHERE age = 25;` with `CREATE INDEX idx_users_age_covering ON users(age, id, name, email)` | The query can be satisfied entirely from the index, no data‚Äëpage fetches. |
| **Stats update** | After heavy inserts/updates | Keeps the optimiser's stats accurate so it can pick the index‚Äëlookup plan. |
| **Query profiling** | When you notice unexpected slowdowns | Tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (Postgres), `EXPLAIN PLAN` (Oracle) or `SHOW PROFILE` (MySQL) will help you confirm the planner is following the index. |

---

## 4. Summary checklist

- **Schema** ‚Äì ensure `age` is of the correct type (INT, SMALLINT, etc.).  
- **Index** ‚Äì `CREATE INDEX idx_users_age ON users(age);`  
- **SELECT** ‚Äì list only the columns you need.  
- **Literal** ‚Äì use a numeric literal (`25`) not a quoted string.  
- **Parameterise** ‚Äì never concatenate user input; use prepared statements.  

By applying all four steps you‚Äôll have a query that is **completely safe from injection**, uses the _right_ data type, reads from an index, and returns no more data than required ‚Äì the triple‚Äëwin formula for performance, security, and maintainability.[0m
=== SYSTEM PROMPT COMPARISON ===

--- Generic System Prompt ---
[94mTo optimize the given query, we can apply several strategies:

1. **Use Explicit JOINs**: Instead of using the implicit join syntax (`FROM orders o, users u WHERE o.user_id = u.id`), use explicit JOINs. This makes the query easier to read and understand, and it can also improve performance by allowing the database to optimize the join order.

2. **Use Indexes**: Ensure that the columns used in the `WHERE` and `JOIN` clauses are indexed. In this case, we should create indexes on `orders.user_id` and `users.id`. This can significantly speed up the query by allowing the database to quickly locate the matching rows.

3. **Use Efficient JOIN Order**: The order in which we join tables can affect performance. In this case, since we're filtering by `o.total > 1000`, it might be more efficient to join `orders` with `users` first, and then filter the results. However, the optimal join order depends on the specific database system and the data distribution.

4. **Limit the Columns Retrieved**: Instead of selecting all columns (`SELECT *`), specify only the columns that are needed. This can reduce the amount of data being transferred and processed, which can improve performance.

Here's the optimized query:

```sql
SELECT o.*, u.*
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE o.total > 1000;
```

Or, if you only need specific columns:

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.total, u.name, u.email
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE o.total > 1000;
```

**Additional Tips:**

- Regularly analyze your database's query performance using tools like EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify bottlenecks.
- Consider partitioning large tables to improve query performance.
- Keep your database indexes up-to-date and ensure they are properly maintained.
- Regularly review and optimize your database schema to ensure it is optimized for your use case.[0m

--- Specific System Prompt ---
[94mTo optimize this query, we'll consider several factors, including indexing, joining, and filtering. Here's an optimized version:

```sql
-- Create indexes on columns used in WHERE and JOIN clauses
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_id ON users (id);

-- Optimize the query
SELECT o.*, u.*
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE o.total > 1000;
```

Here's what changed:

1. **Indexing**: We created indexes on the `user_id` column in the `orders` table and the `id` column in the `users` table. This will significantly speed up the join operation, as the database can quickly locate the matching rows in the `users` table.
2. **Inner join**: We replaced the implicit join syntax (`FROM orders o, users u WHERE o.user_id = u.id`) with an explicit inner join (`INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id`). This makes the query easier to read and understand.
3. **Removed unnecessary columns**: We removed the `SELECT *` and instead specified the columns we actually need (`o.*` and `u.*`). This reduces the amount of data being transferred and processed, which can improve performance.

Additional suggestions:

* If you're using a database management system that supports it (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL 8.0+), consider using a **covering index** on the `orders` table to include the `total` column. This can further improve performance by reducing the need for a table scan.
* If the `orders` table is very large, consider using a **partitioning** strategy to split the data into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can improve query performance and reduce the load on the database.
* If the `users` table is very large, consider using a **materialized view** or a **derived table** to reduce the number of joins and improve performance.

Example use case:

Suppose you have a large e-commerce database with millions of orders and users. You want to retrieve all orders with a total value greater than $1000, along with the corresponding user information. The optimized query above will efficiently retrieve the required data, leveraging indexes and a proper join strategy to minimize the load on the database.[0m

--- Context-Rich System Prompt ---
[94m**Optimizing the Query**

The given query is a simple join between two tables, `orders` and `users`, on the condition that the `user_id` in `orders` matches the `id` in `users`. The query also filters the results to only include orders with a total value greater than 1000.

**Original Query**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders o, users u 
WHERE o.user_id = u.id AND o.total > 1000;
```
**Optimized Query**

To optimize this query, we can use an `INNER JOIN` instead of the implicit join syntax. This makes the query more readable and maintainable. We can also add an index on the `user_id` column in the `orders` table to improve the join performance.

```sql
-- Create an index on user_id in orders table
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders (user_id);

-- Optimized query
SELECT o.*, u.* 
FROM orders o 
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id 
WHERE o.total > 1000;
```
**Explanation**

1.  We create an index on the `user_id` column in the `orders` table to speed up the join operation.
2.  We use an `INNER JOIN` to explicitly specify the join condition, making the query more readable and maintainable.
3.  We select only the columns we need (`o.*` and `u.*`) to reduce the amount of data being transferred and processed.

**Additional Recommendations**

*   Consider adding an index on the `total` column in the `orders` table to improve the filtering performance.
*   If the `orders` table is very large, consider using a covering index on the `user_id` and `total` columns to reduce the number of rows being scanned.
*   If the query is still performing poorly, consider partitioning the `orders` table by date or other relevant columns to reduce the amount of data being scanned.

**Example Use Case**

Suppose we have the following data in the `orders` and `users` tables:

`orders` table:

| id | user_id | total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | 1      | 1000  |
| 2  | 1      | 2000  |
| 3  | 2      | 500   |
| 4  | 3      | 1500  |

`users` table:

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| 1  | John |
| 2  | Jane |
| 3  | Bob  |

The optimized query will return the following result:

| id | user_id | total | name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | 1      | 1000  | John |
| 2  | 1      | 2000  | John |
| 4  | 3      | 1500  | Bob  |[0m
