Ever tried explaining something to someone and they completely misunderstood you? Now imagine that someone is an AI that takes everything literally. That's prompting in a nutshell.

## The Problem: Lost in Translation

When you ask an LLM to "make it better", what exactly does "better" mean? More concise? More detailed? More formal? The model doesn't know unless you tell it. And here's the kicker — even when you think you're being clear, you're probably not.

## Article Structure

### 1. **The Intent Gap: What You Think vs What You Say**
- Real examples of prompt failures
- Why context matters more than you think
- The hidden assumptions in your requests

### 2. **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals**
- System vs User prompts: who does what?
- The power of few-shot learning
- Chain-of-thought: making the model show its work

### 3. **Advanced Prompting Patterns**
- Role-playing prompts ("You are a...")
- Constraint-based prompting
- Output formatting tricks that actually work

### 4. **Intent Recognition Techniques**
- Semantic similarity matching
- Intent classification strategies
- Handling ambiguous requests

### 5. **Real-World Implementation**
```python
# Code example: Building a prompt optimizer
class PromptOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

### 6. **Common Pitfalls & Solutions**
- Over-engineering prompts
- Ignoring model limitations
- The temperature trap

### 7. **Measuring Success**
- Prompt performance metrics
- A/B testing strategies
- User satisfaction indicators

## Key Takeaways

- Clear intent beats complex prompts
- Context is everything
- Test, measure, iterate
