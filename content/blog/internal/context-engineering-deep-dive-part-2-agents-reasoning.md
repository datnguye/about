Your LLM can write code, answer questions, and generate content. But can it plan a complex project, break it down, delegate tasks, and coordinate results? That's where agents come in ‚Äî and things get REALLY interesting.

## The Reality Check

Single LLM calls are like having one genius locked in a room. Agents? They're like having an entire team with specialized skills, memory, and the ability to use tools. The difference? Night and day.

## Article Structure

### 1. **From Chatbots to Agents: The Evolution**
- Why simple prompting isn't enough anymore
- The reasoning gap in traditional LLMs
- Real scenarios where agents shine

### 2. **Agent Architecture Patterns**
- ReAct: Reasoning + Acting
- Plan-and-Execute strategies
- Self-reflection loops that actually work

### 3. **Multi-Agent Systems: The Power of Collaboration**
```python
# Building a research team with CrewAI
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

researcher = Agent(
    role='Senior Research Analyst',
    goal='Find accurate information',
    # More config...
)
```

### 4. **LangGraph: Orchestrating Complex Workflows**
- State machines for agent coordination
- Conditional routing based on outputs
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 5. **Reasoning Engines Under the Hood**
- Chain-of-thought vs Tree-of-thought
- Self-consistency checking
- Metacognitive strategies

### 6. **Production Challenges**
- Agent hallucinations and how to prevent them
- Cost optimization (because tokens aren't free)
- Debugging agent conversations

### 7. **Real Implementation: Building a Code Review System**
```python
# Complete working example
class CodeReviewOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'architect': ArchitectAgent(),
            'security': SecurityAgent(),
            'performance': PerformanceAgent()
        }
```

### 8. **Performance Metrics**
- Task completion rates
- Reasoning accuracy measurements
- Cost per decision analysis

## The Gotchas Nobody Talks About

- Agents can argue with each other (seriously)
- Infinite loops are real
- Context windows matter MORE with agents

## What Actually Works

All the fancy frameworks aside, here's what delivers results:
- Clear role definitions
- Explicit success criteria
- Structured communication protocols

## Next Up

Now that our agents can think and reason, how do they access the knowledge they need? Enter RAG systems...
