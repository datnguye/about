Every new conversation with ChatGPT starts from zero. It doesn't remember you, your preferences, or that bug you fixed together last week. But what if it could? Memory systems are the missing piece — and implementing them right is trickier than you'd think.

## The Amnesia Problem

Your LLM is brilliant but has the memory of a goldfish. Every API call is a fresh start. For a chatbot, that's annoying. For a production system? It's a dealbreaker.

## Article Structure

### 1. **Memory Types: Not All Memories Are Equal**
- **Conversation Memory**: What just happened
- **Entity Memory**: Who and what we're talking about
- **Procedural Memory**: How to do things
- **Episodic Memory**: What happened when

### 2. **Short-Term Memory: The Working Context**
```python
class ConversationMemory:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=2000):
        self.messages = []
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
    
    def add_message(self, role, content):
        self.messages.append({"role": role, "content": content})
        self._trim_to_fit()
    
    def _trim_to_fit(self):
        # Smart trimming: keep system prompt, recent messages
        while self.get_token_count() > self.max_tokens:
            # Remove middle messages, keep first and last
            if len(self.messages) > 3:
                self.messages.pop(1)
```

### 3. **Long-Term Memory: The Persistent Brain**
- Vector-based semantic memory
- Graph databases for relationships
- Time-series stores for temporal data

### 4. **Memory Architectures in Production**
```python
from redis import Redis
from typing import List, Dict
import json

class HybridMemorySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis = Redis()  # Short-term
        self.pinecone = Pinecone()  # Long-term semantic
        self.neo4j = Neo4j()  # Relationship memory
    
    def remember(self, interaction):
        # Store in multiple systems based on type
        self.redis.setex(
            f"recent:{interaction.id}",
            ttl=3600,  # 1 hour cache
            value=json.dumps(interaction.dict())
        )
        
        # Semantic storage for important facts
        if interaction.importance > 0.7:
            self.pinecone.upsert(
                vectors=[(interaction.id, interaction.embedding)]
            )
```

### 5. **Memory Retrieval Strategies**
- Recency-based retrieval
- Similarity-based retrieval
- Importance-weighted retrieval
- Hybrid approaches that actually work

### 6. **The Forgetting Problem (And Why It's Good)**
```python
class SmartForgetting:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_scores = {}
    
    def update_importance(self, memory_id, accessed=False):
        # Exponential decay with access bumps
        current_score = self.memory_scores.get(memory_id, 1.0)
        if accessed:
            self.memory_scores[memory_id] = min(current_score * 1.2, 1.0)
        else:
            self.memory_scores[memory_id] = current_score * 0.95
    
    def prune_memories(self, threshold=0.1):
        # Forget memories below importance threshold
        to_forget = [
            mid for mid, score in self.memory_scores.items()
            if score < threshold
        ]
        return to_forget
```

### 7. **Real Implementation: Customer Support Bot**
```python
class SupportBotMemory:
    def __init__(self, customer_id):
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.load_customer_history()
    
    def get_context(self, current_query):
        return {
            'recent_tickets': self.get_recent_tickets(days=30),
            'product_info': self.get_customer_products(),
            'similar_issues': self.find_similar_issues(current_query),
            'interaction_style': self.get_preferences()
        }
```

### 8. **Memory Compression Techniques**
- Summarization strategies
- Key fact extraction
- Conversation threading
- Semantic deduplication

### 9. **Cost Optimization**
```python
class MemoryBudget:
    def calculate_storage_cost(self, memory_type):
        costs = {
            'conversation': 0.01,  # per 1000 tokens
            'vector': 0.02,  # per 1000 embeddings
            'graph': 0.05  # per 1000 relationships
        }
        # Implement tiered storage strategy
```

### 10. **Privacy & Compliance**
- GDPR-compliant forgetting
- User data segregation
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit trails for memory access

## The Hard Truths

1. **Memory isn't free**: Every token stored costs money
2. **Context windows are limited**: You can't remember everything
3. **Retrieval adds latency**: Speed vs completeness tradeoff
4. **Privacy matters**: Not all memories should be kept

## What Actually Works in Production

After building memory systems for various applications:
- **Hybrid approach wins**: Combine multiple memory types
- **Smart forgetting is essential**: Not everything needs remembering
- **Compression is your friend**: Summarize aggressively
- **User control is critical**: Let users manage their memories

## Performance Metrics

- Memory retrieval latency
- Relevance score of retrieved memories
- Storage cost per user
- Memory impact on response quality

## The Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define memory retention policies
- [ ] Implement importance scoring
- [ ] Set up tiered storage (hot/warm/cold)
- [ ] Add privacy controls
- [ ] Monitor costs religiously

## Looking Forward

With prompting, reasoning, knowledge, tools, and memory in place, you've got all the pieces. But how do you put them together into a production system that actually works? That's the real challenge...
