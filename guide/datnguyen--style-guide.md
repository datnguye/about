- Often mention specific technologies
- Keep under 160 characters when possible

### 3. **Tag Usage**
- Technology-specific tags (TSQL, Snowflake, dbt)
- Action-oriented tags (DataMasking, Deployment)
- Framework/tool tags (CrewAI, LangGraph)
- Usually 3-6 tags per post

### 4. **Platform Adaptation**

## Example Voice Application

**Original bland statement:**
"It is possible to convert numbers to words using SQL."

**Dat's style:**
"With raw SQL, it is 100% possible to convert a number to words in a particular language. All we need is to have the algorithm. Let's pick the English one — which is the most popular language."

## Key Differentiators

1. **Practical First**: Every post solves a real problem
2. **Code-Centric**: Examples drive the narrative
3. **Time-Conscious**: Respects reader's time with concise content
4. **Solution-Focused**: Less theory, more implementation
5. **Accessible Expertise**: Technical depth without intimidation
